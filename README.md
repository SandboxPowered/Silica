## What is Silica?
Silica is a complete rewrite of Minecraft's internals, similar to projects like [Glowstone](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone).

However, Silica aims to rewrite the client as well as the server, using modern technologies targeting modern hardware.

## Current Status

Silica is in the very early stages of development and still in a proof of concept state. Major refactors will happen while the project grows. Join the Discord Server if you want to see the latest state of our development.

## Contributing
Silica is open to any and all contributions, for larger contributions however we recommend discussing with the team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fTZSX9Y7uz) to avoid duplicated or wasted work
